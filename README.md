# recommendations-engine
Deliver recommendations for products, articles, or media content as a SaaS. Clients can integrate the recommendation API with their own applications to get personalized suggestions for their users.

1. High-Level Architecture

1.1 Microservices Overview
	1.	Recommendation Service: Core logic to generate and return recommendations.
	2.	Data Ingestion/Processing Service: Aggregates user interactions (clicks, purchases, likes, etc.) to update recommendation models or data stores.
	3.	User Profile Service: Manages user details, preferences, and behavioral data.
	4.	Product/Content Catalog Service (optional depending on your domain): Stores metadata about the items being recommended (e.g., product descriptions, categories).
	5.	Authentication/Authorization Service (or integrate an existing solution): Manages multi-tenant access tokens, user roles, etc.

1.2 Logical Flow
	1.	Client App (external consumer) queries the Recommendation API, passing a user identifier or session context.
	2.	Recommendation Service retrieves relevant user data from the User Profile Service.
	3.	Recommendation Service fetches item metadata from the Product/Content Catalog and applies a recommendation algorithm (collaborative filtering, content-based, etc.).
	4.	Ingestion Service updates the recommendation model (incorporate a real-time or near-real-time system) whenever new user interactions are received.

2. Core Tech Stack

2.1 Java Framework
	•	Spring Boot (most popular for microservices in Java):
	•	Rapid startup and production readiness.
	•	Spring Web for REST endpoints.
	•	Spring Data for easy database integration.
	•	Spring Security for authentication and multi-tenant handling.

2.2 Data Storage
	•	NoSQL Database (MongoDB):
	•	Flexible schema to store user profiles, preferences, and usage events.
	•	Easy to store complex JSON documents (like user activities).
	•	Scalable and widely adopted, making it a good fit for large volumes of user or product data.
	•	Optional: SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL):
	•	Could be used for storing more structured data (e.g., product catalogs, transactional data).
	•	Some developers prefer having at least a portion of data in a relational schema for ACID compliance.

2.3 Caching Layer
	•	Redis:
	•	Great for storing frequently accessed data (hot items, popular recommendations).
	•	Offers features like pub/sub if you need real-time notifications.
	•	High performance, low latency.

2.4 Containerization
	•	Docker for packaging each microservice.
	•	Docker Compose initially for local development and testing.
	•	Kubernetes (K8s) for production-like orchestration:
	•	Each microservice has its own deployment, service, and horizontal pod autoscaler configuration.
	•	Consider Helm charts for easier packaging and deployment of your microservices as a set.

2.5 Messaging (Optional)
	•	RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka:
	•	Useful for asynchronous communication between the ingestion service and the recommendation service (for event-driven updates).
	•	Kafka is strong for real-time stream processing if you plan to evolve into near-real-time recommendations.

2.6 Machine Learning / Recommendation Algorithms
	•	Java-based libraries (e.g., Mahout, DL4J) in the Java ecosystem.
	•	Alternatively, Python microservice (e.g., Flask or FastAPI container) for ML:
	•	The Java services can call this via REST gRPC.
	•	Allows dto use Python’s mature ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow) for recommendation tasks.

2.7 Security & Multi-Tenancy
	•	Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
	•	Assign a tenant ID within the token claims to identify which organization or customer is calling.
	•	Enforce tenant isolation in the data layer (e.g., using separate schemas/collections or a shared schema with tenant field filters).

2.8 Monitoring & Observability
	•	Prometheus for metrics and Grafana for dashboards.
	•	ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or EFK (Fluentd, Elasticsearch, Kibana) for log management and analytics.
	•	Sleuth/Zipkin for distributed tracing to understand inter-service latencies.
