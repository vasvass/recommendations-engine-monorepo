# recommendations-engine
Deliver recommendations for products, articles, or media content as a SaaS. Clients can integrate the recommendation API with their own applications to get personalized suggestions for their users.

1. High-Level Architecture

1.1 Microservices Overview
	1.	Recommendation Service: Core logic to generate and return recommendations.
	2.	Data Ingestion/Processing Service: Aggregates user interactions (clicks, purchases, likes, etc.) to update recommendation models or data stores.
	3.	User Profile Service: Manages user details, preferences, and behavioral data.
	4.	Product/Content Catalog Service (optional depending on your domain): Stores metadata about the items being recommended (e.g., product descriptions, categories).
	5.	Authentication/Authorization Service (or integrate an existing solution): Manages multi-tenant access tokens, user roles, etc.

1.2 Logical Flow
	1.	Client App (external consumer) queries the Recommendation API, passing a user identifier or session context.
	2.	Recommendation Service retrieves relevant user data from the User Profile Service.
	3.	Recommendation Service fetches item metadata from the Product/Content Catalog and applies a recommendation algorithm (collaborative filtering, content-based, etc.).
	4.	Ingestion Service updates the recommendation model (incorporate a real-time or near-real-time system) whenever new user interactions are received.

2. Core Tech Stack

2.1 Java Framework
	•	Spring Boot (most popular for microservices in Java):
	•	Rapid startup and production readiness.
	•	Spring Web for REST endpoints.
	•	Spring Data for easy database integration.
	•	Spring Security for authentication and multi-tenant handling.

2.2 Data Storage
	•	NoSQL Database (MongoDB):
	•	Flexible schema to store user profiles, preferences, and usage events.
	•	Easy to store complex JSON documents (like user activities).
	•	Scalable and widely adopted, making it a good fit for large volumes of user or product data.
	•	Optional: SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL):
	•	Could be used for storing more structured data (e.g., product catalogs, transactional data).
	•	Some developers prefer having at least a portion of data in a relational schema for ACID compliance.

2.3 Caching Layer
	•	Redis:
	•	Great for storing frequently accessed data (hot items, popular recommendations).
	•	Offers features like pub/sub if you need real-time notifications.
	•	High performance, low latency.

2.4 Containerization
	•	Docker for packaging each microservice.
	•	Docker Compose initially for local development and testing.
	•	Kubernetes (K8s) for production-like orchestration:
	•	Each microservice has its own deployment, service, and horizontal pod autoscaler configuration.
	•	Consider Helm charts for easier packaging and deployment of your microservices as a set.

2.5 Messaging (Optional)
	•	RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka:
	•	Useful for asynchronous communication between the ingestion service and the recommendation service (for event-driven updates).
	•	Kafka is strong for real-time stream processing if you plan to evolve into near-real-time recommendations.

2.6 Machine Learning / Recommendation Algorithms
	•	Java-based libraries (e.g., Mahout, DL4J) if you want to stay purely in the Java ecosystem.
	•	Alternatively, Python microservice (e.g., Flask or FastAPI container) for ML:
	•	The Java services can call this via REST gRPC.
	•	Allows you to use Python’s mature ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow) for recommendation tasks.

2.7 Security & Multi-Tenancy
	•	Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
	•	Assign a tenant ID within the token claims to identify which organization or customer is calling.
	•	Enforce tenant isolation in the data layer (e.g., using separate schemas/collections or a shared schema with tenant field filters).

2.8 Monitoring & Observability
	•	Prometheus for metrics and Grafana for dashboards.
	•	ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or EFK (Fluentd, Elasticsearch, Kibana) for log management and analytics.
	•	Sleuth/Zipkin for distributed tracing to understand inter-service latencies.

3. Initial Project Roadmap

 Outline of a possible iterative approach as as to handle project in manageable chunks:
	1.	Project Setup and Skeleton
	•	Initialization of a Git repository monorepo.
	•	Set up basic Spring Boot dependencies (Web, Data, Security).
	•	Implement minimal endpoints (e.g., a health check).
	2.	User Profile Service
	•	Define user model (username, email, preferences, etc.).
	•	Connect to MongoDB or chosen database.
	•	Implement basic CRUD endpoints.
	3.	Product Catalog Service (if applicable to recommendation domain)
	•	Define product/content metadata models.
	•	Connect to the database (could be the same or a different instance from the user profiles).
	•	Simple REST endpoints for retrieving product data.
	4.	Ingestion/Processing Service
	•	Create endpoints to receive user actions (clicks, likes, purchases).
	•	Store these interaction events in a NoSQL store or queue them in Kafka for async processing.
	•	(Optional) Batch process or stream process these events into a model store.
	5.	Recommendation Service
	•	Basic version: Return a static “top trending” list or a naive rule-based recommendation for a start.
	•	Advanced version: Integrate a collaborative filtering or content-based filtering library.
	•	Connect to the Ingestion service’s data store or model to fetch relevant data.
	•	Implement an endpoint that returns recommended items for a user ID.
	6.	Dockerization
	•	Add Dockerfiles for each microservice.
	•	Use Docker Compose locally for orchestrating multiple services.
	7.	Kubernetes Deployment
	•	Write Kubernetes YAML files or create Helm charts.
	•	Deploy each microservice (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap/Secret for environment variables).
	•	Verify inter-service communication, scaling, and potential node restrictions.
	8.	Security & Multi-Tenancy
	•	Secure endpoints with JWT tokens (or OAuth2 if you prefer).
	•	Add the concept of a tenantId to separate data.
	•	Use role-based access control or attribute-based access control as needed.
	9.	Monitoring & Observability
	•	Integrate Prometheus metrics into Spring Boot apps (actuator endpoints).
	•	Configure a Grafana dashboard for real-time insights.
	•	Setup a log aggregator for deeper analytics if needed.
	10.	Refinement & Scaling
	•	Adjust recommendation algorithm to improve accuracy.
	•	Implement caching with Redis for hot data (top recommended items).
	•	Optimize the Docker/K8s setup for performance.
	•	Add more sophisticated features like AB testing, personalized dashboards, etc.
